Jingle Bell Bingo
===

Ah, Christmas time. A time of festive good will, joyful song, and friendship to our fellow humans. Or at least it's supposed to be when we're not suffering through yet another rendition of "Hark! A Herald Angel Sings" (this time it's a dubstep remix of Neil Diamond for bonus irony points).

Well, now at least, there's a little help to keep from stabbing the mall Santa with the broken off leg of Rudolph. Just tap the songs you hear and when you score a bingo, you'll get something else to listen to. A bit of a palette cleanser, so to speak, before descending back into the maddening Red and Green dementia that surrounds us all.
